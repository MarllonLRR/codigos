I @watchdogsgame Who had the idea of putting: "Hacking abilities" in the game? Is it @Design_Cave ? #askwd
I .@Mazmorrero It was inspired from Cabrini-Green which was leveled years ago but is still a Chicago landmark. #askwd
I #askwd - not a question but I wanted to share this. Watch Dogs is the greatest game I've ever played! Thank you for this beautiful game !
I @watchdogsgame Who decided to add the trophy "Social Lubricant" - most time consuming trophy in my opinion. #askwd
I @watchdogsgame The dialogue and "profiles" are very raw/realistic. Did that come naturally when making the game or was emphasis made? #askwd
I @Watchdogsgame #askwd thanks for the Super Stakes Hold 'Em! $ has never been an issue
I #askwd not a question but lived in Chicago all my life and always wanted an open world game starring this city so thank you ^_^
I #askwd why would aiden not have noticed all the texts in the merlaut and have called clara to prevent her needless death?
I Want to teach #computersc? Go to MIT. But for best ROI pick a state school. @ITworld 
I excellent rules for a #computersc classroom from @hackerschool https://www.hackerschool.com/manua 
I New logo decals on our ACM student lounge space. We want everyone on campus to know about #computersc. pic.twitter.com/xLBdzIXsEY
I .@Predator4246 From a Level Design perspective,the architecture is very varied and we wanted to design around the bridges and water. #askwd
I @watchdogsgame When did you guys start the development or creation of Watch Dogs ? #askwd
I Team of @codeacademy @google @donorschoose wants more girls in #computersc: http://tnw.co/1pNhtdE  via @TheNextWeb
I @watchdogsgame What is your favourite mission in the game? A tricky one, I know. #askwd
I We have less #computersc grads today than in the 1980s, yet we’re on track to add 1.2M jobs by 2020 http://ow.ly/y9rkR  @tasneemraja
I RT @UFCISE New logo decals on our ACM student lounge space. We want everyone on campus to know about #computersc
I @watchdogsgame #askwd When it came to making Chicago, what was one of the biggest challenges?
